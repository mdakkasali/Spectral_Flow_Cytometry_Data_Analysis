## Repository Purpose

This repository provides the comprehensive analysis pipeline, annotated Jupyter Notebooks, and links to the Figshare dataset, as described in the manuscript. The pipeline is designed to enhance the interrogation of high-dimensional immune cell data through spectral flow cytometry, addressing the complexities associated with large antibody panels and traditional bi-axial gating strategies.

### Key Resources Included:
- Analysis pipeline implementation
- Annotated Jupyter Notebooks with step-by-step analysis
- Links to associated Figshare datasets
- Reproducible workflows for high-dimensional immune cell characterization

### 1. Sample Preparation
- [Please update with specific sample prep methods from paper]

### 2. Spectral Flow Cytometry
- [Please update with cytometry methods from paper]

### 3. Data Handling & Processing
- Data import and quality control
- Initial preprocessing and filtering

### 4. Batch Correction
- [Please update with specific batch correction methods from paper]

### 5. Clustering Analysis
- Unsupervised clustering approaches
- Dimensionality reduction techniques

### 6. Statistical Analysis
- Differential expression analysis
- Advanced statistical techniques for high-dimensional data
